        Usage: certapi connections <url> [-n <count>] [--parallel <count>] [transport options]

        Answers "am I actually reusing connections?" — by making the requests and reporting which
        connection each one went out on.

        Reusing a pooled connection skips a TCP handshake and a TLS handshake, which on a remote
        endpoint is most of the time a small request takes. Whether it is happening is normally
        invisible: the responses look identical either way. This makes it visible.

        The report lists the connections opened to that URL's origin, with protocol version, peer
        address, when each opened and how many requests went over it — then says plainly whether
        reuse is working. More requests than connections means it is. (Connections this process
        made to other origins are counted in a closing line but not mixed into the answer.)

        Common causes when it is not: the server answers 'Connection: close', a proxy sits in the
        way, or each request is built with a fresh client.

        Options:
          -n <count>              How many requests to send (default 4)
          --parallel <count>      Send this many at a time (default 1, one after another).
                                  Parallel requests need one connection each, so a pool that is
                                  working still shows several — the useful number is connections
                                  compared with requests, not connections alone
          --json                  Print the report as JSON instead of text

        Certificate and transport options work here exactly as for `certapi send`, including
        --cert, --cert-file, --insecure, --proxy, --http1.1 and --http2.

        Global: --debug (verbose diagnostics) and --log-file <path> work here too.

        Examples:
          certapi connections https://api.example.com/health
          certapi connections https://api.internal/orders --cert "CN=My Client" -n 10
          certapi connections https://api.example.com/health -n 8 --parallel 4

        Exit 0 when the requests were made (whatever they answered), 3 when none could be sent,
        2 usage.
