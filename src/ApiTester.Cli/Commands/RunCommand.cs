        Usage: certapi run <Collection[/Folder][/Request]> [options]
               certapi run --all [options]
               certapi run --chain <name> [options]
               certapi run <file.har> [--cert <thumb|subject> | --cert-file <path>] [options]

        Runs saved requests. A folder or collection path runs everything beneath it as a
        suite; a request path runs that one request. A request passes when its assertions all
        pass (Status / Time / Header / Body / Body-text checks set on it in the app); a request
        with no assertions passes on any 2xx response. Failed assertions are listed on stderr.

        A <file.har> positional (captured in a browser, or by certapi send/run --har) replays
        its entries in file order as an ordered suite instead — WITH the client certificate you
        name attached, so a session captured in Chrome DevTools replays authenticated. A HAR
        entry carries no assertions, so it passes on any 2xx response. A HAR run never writes to
        saved state (it isn't a saved collection), matching --workspace semantics.

        Options:
          --all                   Run every saved request in the workspace
          --workspace <file>      Load collections from a workspace file (default: live GUI state)
          --env <name>            Environment for {{variables}}; --var k=v overrides (repeatable)
          --data <file>           Data-driven run: repeat the request(s) once per row of a CSV or
                                  JSON file, the row's columns overriding {{variables}}
          --record / --no-record  Write known-good results back (default: on for live state,
                                  off for workspace files; skipped while the GUI is running)
          --strict-vars           Unresolved {{tokens}} fail the request
          --no-auto-token         Don't attach captured session tokens or cookies during this run
          --cookies               Keep a cookie jar for the run, so a login's Set-Cookie is sent
                                  on later requests (cookie-based sessions)
          --json                  JSON results instead of the table
          --har <file>            Capture the whole suite (every request, and every redirect hop)
                                  as one HAR file, written once when the run finishes
          --har-include-secrets   Don't redact Authorization/Proxy-Authorization/Cookie/
                                  Set-Cookie values in the captured HAR (redacted by default)

        Chains:
          --chain <name>          Run a saved chain: its requests, in the order the chain names them,
                                  as one unit — so a token captured by one step is usable by the next
                                  through its {{variable}}. A chain names its own requests, so it takes
                                  no positional and does not combine with --all or --diff-har; --data
                                  is refused too, because whether a row would repeat the whole chain
                                  or each step within it is not defined.
                                  A failing step stops the chain unless that step is marked to carry
                                  on; the steps that never ran are listed as SKIP and count as neither
                                  passed nor failed. Any failed step exits 1.
                                  Captures write into the environment the chain names (created if it
                                  does not exist yet); an explicit --env wins over it, because a flag
                                  you typed is a more specific instruction than a stored default.

        Diff:
          --diff-har <file.har>   Replay a HAR and compare each response against the one it
                                  recorded — regression-testing an API against a captured
                                  session. Names the archive itself, so it takes no positional
                                  and does not combine with --all. An entry passes only when its
                                  diff is identical (the status is part of the diff), and any
                                  difference exits 1: there is no --diff-fail here, because
                                  diffing the capture is the whole point of the flag.
          --diff-ignore <path>    JSON path to ignore, e.g. data.timestamp (repeatable; a trailing
                                  * on a segment matches by prefix)
          --diff-ignore-header <n>  Header to ignore on top of the volatile defaults (repeatable)

        TLS / certificates (for a <file.har> replay only — a saved request carries its own):
          --cert <thumb|subject>  Client certificate from the Windows store
          --store <location>      CurrentUser (default); LocalMachine searches both stores
          --cert-file <path>      Client certificate from a file (.pfx/.p12 or .pem/.crt) instead
          --cert-password <pw>    Password for a .pfx/.p12 certificate file
          --key-file <path>       Private-key file for a PEM cert whose key is separate


        """ + TransportFlags.Help + """


        A saved request keeps its own transport settings; a flag here overrides only what it
        names, for every request in the run.

        Requests whose Auth is "Auto" attach the captured token for their host; a token
        captured by one request (e.g. a login) is reused by the rest of the suite.

        Global: --debug (verbose diagnostics) and --log-file <path> work here too.

        Examples:
          # Run one request, a folder, or everything
          certapi run "petstore/Get pet by id"
          certapi run petstore/smoke
          certapi run --all

          # A login-first suite: the login response's token carries through the suite
          certapi run "api/login then browse" --env Staging

          # The same thing as a saved chain: step 1 logs in, step 2 uses the token it captured
          certapi run --chain "login then browse"

          # Data-driven: run one request once per row of users.csv (columns become {{variables}})
          certapi run "api/Get user" --data .\users.csv

          # CI: machine-readable results, no writes at all, fail the job on any failure
          certapi run --all --workspace .\suite.json --no-record --no-auto-token --json

          # Investigate a flaky suite with full diagnostics
          certapi run api --debug --log-file suite-debug.log

          # Capture the whole suite as a HAR file for later replay or review
          certapi run --all --har suite.har

          # Replay a browser session's HAR through mutual TLS
          certapi run session.har --cert "CN=Me"

          # Regression-test against that capture: any difference from what it recorded fails
          certapi run --diff-har session.har --cert "CN=Me" --diff-ignore data.generatedAt

        Exit codes: 0 all passed · 1 any failure · 2 usage · 3 data error.
