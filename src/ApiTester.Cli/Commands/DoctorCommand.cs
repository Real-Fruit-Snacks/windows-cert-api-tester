        Usage: certapi doctor <url> [options]

        Diagnoses a connection one stage at a time — URL, DNS, proxy decision, TCP, the proxy
        tunnel, the TLS handshake, and finally an HTTP GET — and reports the stage that broke
        rather than a single error line. Every stage is timed.

        What it can tell you that a normal request cannot:
          * the certificate authorities the server accepts client certificates from, matched
            against the certificates you actually have ("none of yours are issued by those")
          * whether this network is decrypting TLS in the middle, which is why a client
            certificate cannot reach the server through it
          * which proxy the machine picks for this URL, including one chosen by a PAC script,
            and what the proxy said if it refused
          * whether the internet is reachable at all, or a captive portal is in the way

        Options:
          --cert <thumb|subject>  Client certificate from the Windows store
          --store <location>      CurrentUser (default); LocalMachine searches both stores
          --cert-file <path>      Client certificate from a file (.pfx/.p12 or .pem/.crt) instead
          --cert-password <pw>    Password for a .pfx/.p12 certificate file
          --key-file <path>       Private-key file for a PEM certificate whose key is separate
          --json                  Print the whole report as JSON instead of text
          -q, --quiet             Only print stages that failed or carry advice
          --md <file>             Also write the diagnosis as a markdown note — the stage table,
                                  every detail line, the advice, and (the part worth keeping) the
                                  server's acceptable client-certificate authorities and any
                                  TLS-interception finding, verbatim
          --md-vault <folder>     Write that note into a vault instead, as
                                  certapi/investigations/<host>-<timestamp>.md. A new note per run:
                                  a diagnosis is history, so nothing overwrites a past one
          --md-open               Open the written note in the default application for it
          --include-secrets       Keep credential-looking query values in the note (redacted by
                                  default — a vault syncs, so the note is likely to leave the
                                  machine)

        """ + "\n" + TransportFlags.StreamHelp + "\n" + """

        Global: --debug (verbose diagnostics) and --log-file <path> work here too.

        Examples:
          certapi doctor https://api.example.com/health
          certapi doctor https://api.example.com --cert "CN=My Client"
          certapi doctor https://api.example.com --proxy http://proxy.corp:8080 --json
          certapi doctor https://api.example.com/health --md investigation.md
          certapi doctor https://api.example.com/health --md-vault C:\Users\me\Vault

        Exit 0 when every stage passed, 1 when one failed, 2 usage, 3 data errors.
