        Usage: certapi bench <url> [options]
               certapi bench <Collection[/Folder]/Request> [options]

        Sends one request over and over and reports how long it took: how many succeeded, the
        rate, and the latency distribution (min/p50/p90/p99/max). Uses the same
        client-certificate send path as `certapi send`, so what it measures is what the rest of
        this tool actually does. A saved-request positional must name exactly one request — a
        bench measures one endpoint.

        Load:
          -n, --count <n>         Total requests to send (default 100)
          -c, --concurrency <n>   Parallel workers (default 10; never more than --count)
          --duration <seconds>    Run for a wall-clock period instead of a fixed count; -n is
                                  then unused, and the two cannot be combined
          --warmup <seconds>      Send for this long first and discard every result, so the
                                  figures describe a warmed-up endpoint. Warm-up requests are
                                  extra — they do not come out of --count.
          --bench-retries         Let the retry flags below apply during the bench (off by default)
          --pool                  Also report the connections this run actually used: how many
                                  were opened and how many requests each served. Turns the note
                                  below into a measurement — a server answering 'Connection:
                                  close' makes every request pay a fresh handshake

        Request:
          -X, --method <m>        HTTP method (default GET)
          -H, --header "k: v"     Add a header (repeatable)
          -d, --data <body>       Request body
          --content-type <ct>     Body content type (default application/json)
          --bearer <token>        Authorization: Bearer …
          --timeout <seconds>     Per-request timeout (default 100)

        On a saved request these override or add to what it already carries; everything else
        about it (its own auth, headers, body, and transport settings) is used as saved. A
        multipart saved request cannot be benched.

        TLS / certificates:

        """ + CliCert.HelpLines + """

          --insecure              Ignore server certificate errors (a certificate pinned with
                                  `certapi trust` is honored without it)

        Variables:
          --env <name>            Environment ({{var}} values) from your workspace
          --var k=v               Override/add a variable (repeatable)
          --workspace <file>      Read environments and saved requests from a workspace file
                                  instead of the live state


        """ + TransportFlags.Help + """


        Retries are forced off during a bench even when --retry or the saved request asks for
        them: a retry turns a failure into a slow success and hides the failure rate the bench
        exists to measure. --bench-retries measures it anyway.

        Output:
          --json                  A JSON envelope instead of the summary table

        What the numbers include:
          Connections are pooled and reused, so only the first request to an origin pays the TCP
          connect and TLS handshake; later requests measure the request and response alone. Use
          --warmup to discard that first-connection cost so the figures describe a warmed-up
          endpoint instead of "how long the first request takes, from cold". A request routed
          through a proxy still opens its own connection every time, because the proxied path
          cannot be pooled — see --proxy above.

        A bench never writes anything: no known-good results, no captured tokens, no state
        file. The workspace is read for {{variables}}, saved requests, and pinned certificates
        only. Captured session tokens are not attached either — a bench sends exactly the
        request you named.

        Global: --debug (verbose diagnostics) and --log-file <path> work here too.

        Examples:
          # 500 requests, 20 at a time, against an mTLS endpoint
          certapi bench https://api.example.com/health --cert "CN=My Client" -n 500 -c 20

          # Run for 30 seconds instead, discarding the first 5 seconds as warm-up
          certapi bench https://api.example.com/health --cert "CN=My Client" --duration 30 --warmup 5

          # Bench an authenticated POST
          certapi bench https://api.example.com/orders --cert "CN=My Client" -X POST \
              -d '{"sku":"A1"}' --bearer $env:TOKEN -n 200 -c 10

          # Bench a saved request (its own auth, headers, body, and transport settings)
          certapi bench "petstore/Get pet by id" -n 200 -c 10

          # Machine-readable, for a CI job that tracks latency over time
          certapi bench https://api.example.com/health --cert "CN=My Client" -n 200 --json

        Exit codes: 0 whenever the bench measured something — it reports numbers rather than
        passing judgement, so an endpoint that answers 503 or 404 every time still exits 0 · 1 only
        when no request got a response at all (the endpoint was unreachable, so there is nothing to
        report but that) · 2 usage · 3 data error.
