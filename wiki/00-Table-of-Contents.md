Every page in this handbook, what each one is for, and — below — a way in by **task** when you
know what you want to do but not what it is called.

## Find it by what you're trying to do

**"It won't connect and I don't know why."**
[`certapi doctor`](23-Troubleshooting.md#start-here-certapi-doctor) makes the connection one stage
at a time and names the stage that broke — including the certificate authorities the server accepts
client certificates from, and whether the network is decrypting TLS in the middle.

**"It works in my browser but not here."**
Almost always the proxy: [`certapi proxy <url>`](23-Troubleshooting.md#it-works-in-my-browser-but-not-here)
shows which one this machine picks for that address, including one a PAC script chose.

**"I need to see what actually went over the wire."**
[`--trace`, `--wire` and `--frames`](23-Troubleshooting.md#watching-what-the-network-stack-actually-did---trace)
— the stack's own events, the plaintext bytes, and HTTP/2 framing. No driver, no administrator
rights.

**"Is it slow, and where?"**
[Reading the timings](23-Troubleshooting.md#its-slow--reading-the-timings) explains which of the
three measurements answers which question — and
[`certapi connections`](23-Troubleshooting.md#am-i-actually-reusing-connections--certapi-connections)
answers whether connection reuse is working at all.

**"I have a `.pfx` / smart card / no certificate at all."**
[Certificates & mTLS](06-Certificates-and-mTLS.md) covers the store, files, and going without.

**"I want this to run in CI."**
[CLI Reference](21-CLI-Reference.md) for the commands and exit codes,
[Testing & Assertions](11-Testing-and-Assertions.md) for making a suite fail a build, and
[Configuration](27-Configuration.md) for keeping the command line short.

**"I already have this API described somewhere else."**
[Import & Export](17-Import-and-Export.md) reads cURL, OpenAPI, Postman, Insomnia, WSDL and HAR.

**"I want a record I can keep or share."**
[Import & Export](17-Import-and-Export.md#export-to-markdown-notes-obsidian-logseq-a-docs-repo)
writes the workspace as linked markdown notes;
[Troubleshooting](23-Troubleshooting.md#keeping-a-diagnosis-doctor---md) keeps a diagnosis, and
[Testing & Assertions](11-Testing-and-Assertions.md#keeping-a-run---md) keeps a run.

**"I need something to test against."**
[Mock Server](18-Mock-Server.md) — including expired certificates, wrong hostnames, slow responses
and failures on demand.

The CLI's own help (`certapi help <command>`) is always the authoritative source for options; these
pages explain what they are for.
