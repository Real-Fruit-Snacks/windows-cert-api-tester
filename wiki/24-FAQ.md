# 24. FAQ

Frequently asked questions (FAQ), short answers.

**Is it free / open source?**
See the `LICENSE` file in the repository.

**Do I need to install anything?**
No. The released `.exe` files are self-contained — the .NET runtime is bundled. They're portable; no
installer, no admin rights. The only optional dependency is the WebView2 runtime, used solely by the
Rendered tab.

**Windows only?**
Yes. It's built on WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and the Windows certificate store — that's
the whole point. There's no
macOS/Linux build.

**Does it store my private keys?**
No. Certificates in the Windows store are used in place — the private key never leaves the store. For
file certificates, the key is loaded into a temporary in-memory container for the handshake and
discarded; nothing is written back out.

**Can I use it without any certificates?**
Yes. Leave the certificate on *— no certificate —* and it's an ordinary API (application programming
interface) client. mTLS (mutual Transport Layer Security) is there when
you need it.

**How do the app and the CLI (command-line interface) relate?**
They're two front ends over one engine, sharing the workspace at
`%AppData%\CertApiTester\state.json`. Build a request in the app and run it with `certapi run`, or the
reverse. See [Core Concepts](04-Concepts.md).

**Where are secrets stored, and are they encrypted?**
In the same workspace file as everything else, but a captured token/cookie, a saved request's auth
secret, and any variable marked **secret** are encrypted with the Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI),
scoped to the Windows user who saved them — never in plain text, and never readable by a different
Windows user or a different machine. Everything else in the file (requests, headers, URLs, names) is
plain JSON so it stays diffable. See [Troubleshooting](23-Troubleshooting.md) for what happens when a
secret can't be decrypted.

**Can I keep a request suite in source control?**
Yes — export a workspace (`certapi export workspace -o suite.json`) or manage a `--workspace` file, and
check it in. By default secrets are stripped from an export (`--include-secrets` keeps them, encrypted
for you), so a checked-in workspace doesn't hand out credentials.

**Does it do OAuth?**
Yes — client-credentials, password, refresh, and interactive authorization-code with PKCE (Proof Key
for Code Exchange), in the app
and (except the interactive flow) via `certapi token`. See [Authentication](08-Authentication.md).

**Does it do Windows Integrated Auth (NTLM (NT LAN Manager) / Kerberos)?**
Yes — a *Windows (integrated)* auth type with SSO (single sign-on) or explicit credentials, and
`--windows-auth` on the
CLI.

**Can an AI (artificial intelligence) agent use it?**
Yes — `certapi mcp` exposes a safe toolset over MCP (Model Context Protocol) with a pinned
certificate and a host allowlist. See
[MCP Server](20-MCP-Server.md).

**The site logs in through a web page, not an API — can I still reuse the session?**
Yes — **Capture session…** opens a browser, you log in on the site itself, and it captures the
resulting cookies and any bearer token, then attaches them automatically to later requests (app and
CLI). See [Session Capture](26-Session-Capture.md).

**Can I test without a real API?**
Yes — `certapi mock` (or **Mock server…** in the app) is a standing local server that echoes requests
and serves `/status`, `/sse`, `/token`, `/windows-auth`, and a WebSocket echo, over HTTP (Hypertext
Transfer Protocol)/TLS/mTLS. See
[Mock Server](18-Mock-Server.md).

**How do I reach a cert-protected API from a tool that can't do mTLS?**
Run `certapi serve <upstream> --cert …` and point the tool at the local port. See
[Local Gateway](19-Local-Gateway.md).

**Is `--insecure` dangerous?**
It skips **server** certificate validation, so only use it for internal/self-signed servers you trust.
It has nothing to do with your client certificate, which is still presented.

**Does it check certificate revocation?**
Only if you ask: `--revocation none|offline|online` defaults to `none`, exactly the previous behavior.
`offline` checks cached certificate revocation lists (CRLs) only; `online` may also query an Online
Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder. A revoked certificate is refused even past a pinned
thumbprint; an unreachable or blocked check (common on a corporate network) is reported but not fatal
unless you add `--revocation-strict`. See [Certificates & mTLS](06-Certificates-and-mTLS.md#checking-for-revocation).

**Where do I report a bug or ask for a feature?**
Open an issue on the repository.
